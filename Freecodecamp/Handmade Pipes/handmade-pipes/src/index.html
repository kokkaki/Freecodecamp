      <p id="img-caption">Welcome to <strong>VAS SAV</strong> the source for handmade pipes . Each pipe available on this site represents many years of experience as a pipe smoker, even more as a casual woodworker and cabinetmaker, a love and appreciation of artistry and harmony, and an entire lifetime of analytical pursuits. All of my pipes combine these experiences into pipes that are comfortable, smoke extremely well, and look great.

       <h1 id="title">Breaking in your pipe</h1> 
<p>Firstly, be aware that you need to smoke your new    pipe slowly. You don't want the pipe to get too      hot and damage the briar before a cake is built      up. I recommend smoking only a half or a third of a bowl of tobacco until the pipe is fully broken in. This can be up to four or five smokes, though exactly how many depends on your smoking style. Whatever you do, don't try to rush the break-in, you might damage the pipe.
Pack half a bowl of mild tobacco
Light the tobacco while taking long, slow draws and moving the match or lighter in a circular motion. Be sure to get the entire top of the tobacco lit.
Take a couple long, slow draws. Be sure these are slow draws. Fast, short puffs will creat hot spots in the tobacco and may damage the naked briar.
Tamp down the top layer of ash, the pipe will probably go out anyway while you're drawing it after lighting. If it doesn't go out, tamp down anyway.
Re-light the pipe as above. Again, be sure to take slow draws.
Smoke slowly. Smoking the pipe quickly will make it too hot, create hot spots in the tobacco, and may burn the briar.
Don't be surprised if you have to re-light your pipe regularly. Until a cake is formed, there isn't much insulation in the bowl, and the pipe may go out periodicaly. Once it has broken in, though, it will stay lit much longer - depending on how you smoke..</p>

     <section id="How to use">  
       <h1 id="tribute-info">Letting your pipe rest</h1>
    <p>
This holds true for all of your pipes, but is especially true during a break-in period. After smoking your pipe, allow it to rest for at least 3 days. Doing this gives the pipe time to air out and "relax". If you smoke it more often, the pipe may go sour, and taste unpleasant. Let it rest, and let it keep the wonderful flavor that you like so much.</p>
